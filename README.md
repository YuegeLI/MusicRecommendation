Music Recommendation

This is the code of the IRDM group coursework. The members in our group are Yuege LI, Xinyu Weng and Wenqing Wang.

There are two main parts code in this project. The first is ‘Preprocessing’, which is used to preprocess the raw data, including sign time period label, rating and divide train and test set. The code in 'Preprocessing' is Java. Another is ‘pyFM’, the model we used in this system to do the recommendation. We use the online resource for implementing factorization machines, https://github.com/coreylynch/pyFM. The code in 'pyFM' is python.
